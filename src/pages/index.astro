    <p>
      i'm a cs student tryna <strong>kill fear through building and content</strong>. i build and share to
      <strong> get out of my own way</strong>. i like sharp tools, clean design, and <strong>projects that actually do sth</strong>. this is
      my <strong>public space</strong> to share my work, thoughts, and everything i'm figuring out along the way.
    </p>

    <p class="my-4">
      i love <strong>losing in random</strong> internet rabbit holes and learning whatever <strong>sparks my brain</strong>. i'd love
      building <strong>PCs</strong> with minimalist setups. i find <strong>art</strong> in the everyday, from cooking to writing poetry, and
      i love <strong>breaking things</strong> to reverse-engineer them. <strong>debating ideas</strong> keeps me sharp, always aiming for <strong
        >honesty and authenticity</strong
      >.
