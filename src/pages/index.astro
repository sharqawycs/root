    <p>
      i'm a cs student tryna kill fear through building and content. i build and share to get out of my own way. i like sharp tools, clean
      design, and projects that actually do sth. this is my public space to share my work, thoughts, and everything i'm figuring out along
      the way.
    </p>

    <p class="my-4">
      i love losing in random internet rabbit holes and learning whatever sparks my brain. i'd love building PCs with minimalist setups. i
      find art in the everyday, from cooking to writing poetry, and i love breaking things to reverse-engineer them. debating ideas keeps me
      sharp, always aiming for honesty and authenticity.
