# Building in Public

As a CS student and aspiring maker, I've decided to embrace the concept of "building in public" - sharing my projects, thoughts, and learning journey openly.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public isn't just about transparency; it's about:

### Accountability

When you share your goals and progress publicly, you're more likely to follow through. The gentle pressure of having an audience helps maintain momentum.

### Learning Through Teaching

Writing about what I'm learning forces me to understand concepts more deeply. If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it well enough.

### Community Building

Sharing my struggles and successes helps connect with others on similar journeys. The CS and maker communities are incredibly supportive.

### Documenting Growth

Looking back at old posts and projects shows how much I've grown. It's easy to forget how far you've come when you're focused on how far you have to go.

## What I'll Share

- Projects I'm working on (both successes and failures)
- Technical concepts I'm learning
- Books and resources that impact my thinking
- Random thoughts about technology, productivity, and life

## The Fear Factor

There's definitely fear involved in putting yourself out there. Fear of judgment, fear of being wrong, fear of not being "good enough" yet.

But I've realized that waiting until I'm "ready" means I'll never start. Everyone is learning, everyone makes mistakes, and the internet needs more authentic voices sharing real journeys rather than polished highlight reels.

So here we go - building in public, one post at a time.
