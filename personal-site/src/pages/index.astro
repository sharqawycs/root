  <p>
    i'm a cs student tryna kill fear through building and content. i build and share to get out of my own way. i like sharp tools, clean
    design, and projects that actually do something. this is my public space to share my work, thoughts, and everything i'm figuring out
    along the way.
  </p>

  <p class="my-4">
    i love losing in random internet rabbit holes and learning whatever sparks my brain. i'd love building PCs with minimalist setups, or
    geeking out over mechanical keyboards. i find art in the everyday, from cooking to writing poetry, and i love breaking things to
    reverse-engineer them. debating ideas keeps me sharp, always aiming for honesty and authenticity.
